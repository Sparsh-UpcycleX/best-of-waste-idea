Slide 1: Introduction

Title: Best of Waste - Smart Waste Sorter System

Subtitle: Automated Waste Segregation and Monitoring Solution

Tagline: Transforming waste into opportunity with smart technology

Slide 2: Problem Statement

Improper waste segregation leads to environmental pollution and inefficient recycling.

Manual sorting is time-consuming, unhygienic, and prone to errors.

Need for an automated, intelligent system to streamline the waste sorting process.

Slide 3: Project Overview

Our solution: An intelligent waste sorter system titled "Best of Waste."

Utilizes multiple sensors to detect waste type.

Automatically sorts waste into three categories: Metal, Plastic, Organic.

Tracks waste levels in storage warehouses and displays data online.

Slide 4: System Components

IR Sensor: Detects presence of an object.

Proximity Switch: Triggers the start of the sorting process.

Raindrop Sensor: Detects moisture level (used to help identify organic waste).

Conveyor Belts: Transports waste through the sorting mechanism.

Sorting Mechanism: Diverts waste into appropriate bins.

Three Bins: Metal, Plastic, and Organic.

Ultrasonic Sensors: Measure the quantity of waste in warehouses.

Firebase: Real-time cloud database to store sensor data.

Website Dashboard: Displays live data for monitoring and analytics.

Slide 5: How It Works - Sorting Process

Waste item is placed on the conveyor.

Proximity switch activates the conveyor belt.

IR sensor detects presence and type of waste material.

Raindrop sensor checks moisture content to help distinguish organic waste.

Based on sensor inputs, system categorizes waste.

Servo motors divert item into appropriate bin (metal, plastic, organic).

Slide 6: How It Works - Storage & Monitoring

Sorted waste is transported via conveyor belts into warehouse sections.

Ultrasonic sensors in each section detect the fill level of waste.

Quantity data is sent to Firebase in real-time.

Web-based dashboard fetches data and displays:

Bin fill percentage

Time of last update

Waste category levels

Slide 7: Website Dashboard Features

Real-time data visualization

Interactive charts for each bin type

Notifications for full bins

Access from desktop or mobile

Firebase backend for secure and scalable data handling

Slide 8: Benefits of Our System

Promotes hygiene and sustainability

Reduces human effort and errors

Efficient recycling and waste tracking

Scalable and IoT-enabled

Real-time monitoring for better waste management

Slide 9: Future Improvements

AI/ML integration for smarter material detection

GPS tracking for waste transportation

Integration with municipal waste systems

Solar-powered system for energy efficiency

Slide 10: Conclusion

The "Best of Waste" system is a step toward a smarter, cleaner future.

Combines sensors, automation, and IoT for efficient waste management.

Encourages responsible disposal and recycling habits.

Slide 11: Thank You!
