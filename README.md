Slide 1: Introduction

Title: Best of Waste - Smart Waste Sorter System

Subtitle: Automated Waste Segregation and Monitoring Solution

Tagline: Transforming waste into opportunity with smart technology

Slide 2: Problem Statement

Improper waste segregation leads to environmental pollution and inefficient recycling.

Manual sorting is time-consuming, unhygienic, and prone to errors.

Need for an automated, intelligent system to streamline the waste sorting process.

Slide 3: Project Overview

Our solution: An intelligent waste sorter system titled "Best of Waste."

Utilizes multiple sensors to detect waste type.

Automatically sorts waste into three categories: Metal, Plastic, Organic.

Tracks waste levels in storage warehouses and displays data online.

Slide 4: System Components

IR Sensor: Detects presence of an object.

Proximity Switch: Triggers the start of the sorting process.

Raindrop Sensor: Detects moisture level (used to help identify organic waste).

Conveyor Belts: Transports waste through the sorting mechanism.

Sorting Mechanism: Diverts waste into appropriate bins.

Three Bins: Metal, Plastic, and Organic.

Ultrasonic Sensors: Measure the quantity of waste in warehouses.

Firebase: Real-time cloud database to store sensor data.

Website Dashboard: Displays live data for monitoring and analytics.

Slide 5: How It Works - Sorting Process

Waste item is placed on the conveyor.

Proximity switch activates the conveyor belt.

IR sensor detects presence and type of waste material.

Raindrop sensor checks moisture content to help distinguish organic waste.

Based on sensor inputs, system categorizes waste.

Servo motors divert item into appropriate bin (metal, plastic, organic).

Slide 6: How It Works - Storage & Monitoring

Sorted waste is transported via conveyor belts into warehouse sections.

Ultrasonic sensors in each section detect the fill level of waste.

Quantity data is sent to Firebase in real-time.

Web-based dashboard fetches data and displays:

Bin fill percentage

Time of last update

Waste category levels

Slide 7: Website Dashboard Features

Real-time data visualization

Interactive charts for each bin type

Notifications for full bins

Access from desktop or mobile

Firebase backend for secure and scalable data handling

Slide 8: Benefits of Our System

Promotes hygiene and sustainability

Reduces human effort and errors

Efficient recycling and waste tracking

Scalable and IoT-enabled

Real-time monitoring for better waste management

Slide 9: Future Improvements

AI/ML integration for smarter material detection

Integration with municipal waste systems

Solar-powered system for energy efficiency


HOW DOES IT WILL WORK 

The **"Best of Waste"** smart waste sorter project is an automated system designed to efficiently categorize and manage different types of waste using a combination of sensors, actuators, and IoT integration. At the start of the process, waste items are placed onto a conveyor belt. The movement of the belt is triggered by a **proximity switch**, which detects when an object is nearby and activates the system. As the waste moves forward, an **infrared (IR) sensor** identifies the presence of an item and begins the classification process. A **raindrop sensor** is used to detect moisture content, which is particularly useful in distinguishing organic waste from dry materials like plastic or metal.

Once the waste type is determined based on sensor inputs, a corresponding **servo motor** is activated to direct the waste into the appropriate bin—**metal**, **plastic**, or **organic**. These bins are not just simple containers; they are connected to additional conveyor belts that transport the sorted waste into designated **warehouse sections**. Inside each warehouse section, an **ultrasonic sensor** measures the fill level of the stored waste. These readings are transmitted in real-time to **Firebase**, a cloud-based database, using a **Wi-Fi module (such as ESP8266)** connected to the Arduino.

The collected data on waste levels is then pulled from Firebase and displayed on a **custom-built website dashboard**. This dashboard provides a clear, user-friendly interface showing each bin's current fill level, the last update time, and alerts when bins approach capacity. This system not only automates waste sorting but also enables efficient monitoring and data-driven decision-making for waste management. In essence, "Best of Waste" brings together automation, smart sensing, and cloud technology to promote sustainable and hygienic waste handling practices.
